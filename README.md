# DMPMWorkLifeBalance
Objective: Identified characteristics associated with high work-life balance and created predictive and descriptive models to provide insights on well-being improvement strategies.

Tools: SAS Enterprise Miner

Key Contributions:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis on a Kaggle dataset (2015-2021) with 24 features and 15,973 observations.
- Built and optimized regression models to predict key factors influencing work-life balance, such as daily steps, personal awards, and social network engagement.
- Achieved a high R-squared value (0.9752), signifying a strong fit of the model.
- Employed ensemble modelling for improved prediction accuracy, resulting in a minimal average squared error.
